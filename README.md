# Recurring-Date-Picking-Components
The Recurring Date Picker is a reusable React component using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. It lets users select recurring dates (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly), customize patterns like "every 3 weeks" or "second Tuesday," and preview them on a mini calendar. It includes unit and integration tests.
